This decision was part of a series of secession movements by Southern states leading up to the American Civil War. Mississippi was the second state to officially secede, following South Carolina, and it was prompted by the growing tensions over issues such as states rights and the institution of slavery.'
    document.getElementById('changeText2').innerText = 'Southern states, including Mississippi, were concerned about the potential encroachment on their states rights and the economic implications of anti-slavery sentiments gaining strength in the Northern states. They believed that their economic system, which heavily relied on slave labor for agriculture, would be jeopardized by increasing anti-slavery sentiments in the North. The election of Abraham Lincoln as President in 1860, who was perceived by Southern states as anti-slavery, further heightened these tensions. The Southern states felt that their interests and way of life were under threat, leading them to secede from the Union and eventually contributing to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.'
